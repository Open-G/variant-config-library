This release (1) adds BSD licensing of library VIs, (2) adds 80% unit test coverage during library build, (3) fixes a problem with the palette menu in 8.x, and (3) better support for escape-coding special characters in section and key names.  For example: Carriage Returns, Line Feeds, non-printable characters, and INI syntax elements ("[", "]", and "=").  This new scheme maintains support INI files that use the legacy encoding scheme.
