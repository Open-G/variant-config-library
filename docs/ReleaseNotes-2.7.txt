This release (1) adds 80% unit test coverage during library build, and (2) better support for escape-coding special characters in section and key names.  For example: Carriage Returns, Line Feeds, non-printable characters, and INI syntax elements ("[", "]", and "=").  This new scheme maintains support INI files that use the legacy encoding scheme.
